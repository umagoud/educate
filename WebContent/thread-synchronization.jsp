<h1>
Thread Synchronization</h1>

			<b>Thread Synchronization:</b> In Multi threading there is a need to
			synchronize the actions of multiple threads and make sure that only
			one thread can access the resource at a given point in time.This
			process is called synchronization.
		<p>Synchronized keyword is used in Synchronization.
<p>
This is used to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.
<p> Synchronization is better option where we want to allow only one thread to access the shared resource.
<p><b>DeadLock:</b>A Deadlock occurs when multiple threads try to access
			the same resource at the same time.
To avoid this we take help of Synchronization.
