<p>
			<b>Java Environment</b>
		</p>
		<p>Java environment includes a large number of development tools
			and hundreds of classes and methods. The development tools are part
			of the system known as Java Development Kit (JDK) and the classes and
			methods are part of the Java Standard Library (JSL), also known as
			the Application Programming Interface (API) JRE stands for the Java
			Runtime Environment. This is the package of software that must be
			installed on a machine in order to run Java applications. That is,
			JRE gives runtime environment or execution environment to a Java
			program. It does not include development tools like compiler or
			debugger etc... JDK or SDK gives JRE and also a compiler. The JRE
			includes the Java Virtual Machine, core classes, and supporting
			files.
		<p>JRE(Java Runtime Environment)
		<p>JVM is colletion of class loader, bytecode verifier, Garbage
			collector and Execution engine.

			<b>Java Development Kit: </b>The Java Development Kit comes with a
			collection of tools that are used for developing and running Java
			programs. They include:
		<p>Appletviewer (for viewing Java applets)
		<p>Javac -Java compiler
		<p>Java - Java interpreter
		<p>Javap - Java desassembler
		<p>Javah - for C header files
		<p>Javadoc - for creating HTML documents
		<p>Jdb - Java debugger it helps us to find errors in our programs
		
		<p>
			<b>Application Programming Interface:</b>The Java Standard Library
			(or API) includes lot of classes and methods grouped into different
			packages. some packages are
		<p>
			<b>1. Language Support Package: </b>A collection of classes and
			methods required for implementing basic features of Java.
		<p>
			<b>2. Utilities Package: </b>A collection of classes to provide
			utility functions such as date and time functions.
		<p>
			<b>3. Input/Output Package:</b> A Collection of classes required for
			input/output manipulation.
		<p>
			<b>4. Networking Package: </b>A Collection of classes for
			communication with other computers via Internet.
		<p>
			<b>5. AWT Package: </b>The Abstract Window Tool Kit package contains
			classes that implements platform-independent graphical user
			interface.
		<p>
			<b>6. Applet Package: </b>This includes a set of classes that allows
			us to create Java applets. The use of these library classes will
			become evident when we start developing Java programs.
