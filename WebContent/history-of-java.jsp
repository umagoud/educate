<h1>History of Java</h1>

<p>		
		<p>1. Java was invented by James Gosling in the year of 1991
			developed by Sun Micro Systems of U.S.A.
		<p>2. In 1991, Patrick Naughton and James Gosling with his
			co-workers started a secret project called Green in Sun Micro System
			Company their primary aim to design a small computer language that
			could be used for consumer devices like cable TV switchboxes,
			Microwave ovens and remote controls. Gosling decided to call his
			language oak.
		<p>3. In 1992, they developed and delivered product called *7 it
			was an extremely intelligent remote control.
		<p>4. In 1995 oak was renamed as java because of some legal
			problems. The main reason is oak was the name of an already available
			computer language so they changed the name to java.
		<p>5. Many popular companies including IBM, Microsoft, Netscape
			and many others support java.</p>
			<p>Java (with a capital J) is a high-level, programming language,
			like C, FORTRAN, Smalltalk, Perl, and many others. And also we can
			say Java is an object-oriented programming language. This means that
			the language is based on the concept of an object. You can use Java
			to write computer applications and thousands of other things computer
			software can do. Using java we can build special programs called
			applets. Applet is a small java program that can be downloaded from
			the Internet and played safely within a web browser.
