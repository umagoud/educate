<h1>Introduction of Java</h1>
		<p>
			<strong><b>Introduction</b></strong> java is a object oriented
			programming language
		<p>
			<b>Procedural programming:</b>A procedural program divides the code
			into smaller blocks called procedures. These procedures can interact
			with each other. The most important point to note in procedural
			programming is the idea of state. The state of a program is stored in
			variables. As the program execution goes on, the state changes. The
			actions (procedures or functions) will change the state (value of the
			variables). Prolog, Pascal, FORTRAN and PL/SQL are examples.
		<p>
			<b>Drawbacks:</b>In procedural language, if the programming code goes
			beyond around 25,000 lines, it becomes unmanageable and especially
			when the project comes for modification at a later stage.
		<p>
			<b>Structured programming:</b>Structured programming is a design
			approach where complex systems are broken down into smaller and more
			manageable pieces. That is, the programmer divides the programs
			source code into logically structured chunks (blocks) of code. The
			advantage is, it makes programs more readable, more reliable and more
			easily maintainer. Structured programming can be seen as a subset of
			procedural programming. It is most famous for removing or reducing
			dependency on the GOTO statement. Delphi and COBOL are examples of
			structured programming language.
		<p>
			<b>Advantages of structured programming language:</b>
		</p>
		<p>Structured programming reduces the complexity. Modularity
			allows the programmer to tackle problems in logical fashion. Also,
			using logical structures ensure that the flow of control is clear and
			readable.
