									<p><b>Why do we use Jira?</b></p>
									<p>JIRA is an issue management platform that allows teams to easily manage their issues throughout their entire lifecycle. It is highly customizable, and can be tailored to fit any workflow you need. It is primarily used in software development as a way to manage and track development efforts.
									<p><b>What is Jira Agile?</b></p>
									<p>JIRA Software is an agile project management tool that supports any agile methodology, be it scrum, kanban, or your own unique flavor. From agile boards to reports, you can plan, track, and manage all your agile software development projects from a single tool.
									<p><b>What is the use of Singleton design pattern in Java?</b><p>
									<p>singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
									The purpose of singleton is to control object creation by keeping private constructor.
									<p><b>What are the main uses of JavaScript?</b></p>
<p>JavaScript is a programming language. It is an open standard.And that is run by most modern browsers.
JavaScript is most commonly used as a client side scripting language. It supports object-oriented programming and procedural programming. It can be used to control web pages on the client side of the browser, server-side programs, and even mobile applications.
JavaScript code is written in an HTML page.JavaScript can detect what browser a person is using and customize the webpages to their browser
<p><b>What is UNIT Testing</b></p>
<p>Unit Testing is a level of software testing where individual function/method of a software are tested. 
<p><b>What is Jenkin</b></p>
<p>Jenkins is a software that allows continuous integration.Continuous Integration is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository at regular intervals.
	<p><b>What is HTML5</b></p>								
<p>HTML5 is the latest of HTML.It is used to build more powerful websites. For this it has new attributes, new elements and behavior.
	<p><b>What is TDD</b></p>
<p>Test Driven development technique.Test-driven development (TDD) is a development technique where you must first write a test that fails before you write new functional code. 
<p>First the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test.
<p><b>What is JUNIT?</b>
<p>JUnit is a unit testing framework. This is used for local testing.In this process Developer first create the test classes then write test.
<p><b>What is ETL?</b>
<p>Extract, Transform and Load(ETL) is a process in data warehousing responsible for pulling data out of the source systems and placing it into a data warehouse.
<p><b>What is JPQL?</b>
<p>Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL) is a platform-independent object-oriented query language defined as part of the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification. 
<p> JPQL allows you to define database queries based on your entity model. It's structure and syntax is very similar to SQL.
<p><b>What is JSTL?</b>
<p>JSTL stands for JSP Standard Tag Library. JSTL is the standard tag library that provides tags to control the JSP page behaviour.
<p>
<p><b>What is microservice?</b>
<p>Microservices is an approach to application development in which a large application is built as a suite of modular services. Each module supports a specific business goal and uses a simple, well-defined interface to communicate with other sets of services.</p>
<br>
<p><b>What is XSLT?</b></p>
<p>XSLT is a language for transforming XML documents into other XML documents. It transform other formats such as HTML for web pages, plain text or XSL Formatting Objects, which may subsequently be converted to other formats, such as PDF, PostScript and PNG.

<p>AJAX is a new technique for creating better, faster, and more interactive web applications with the help of XML, HTML, CSS, and Java Script.</p>
<p><b>What is XPath?</b></p>
<p>XPath (XML Path Language) is a query language for selecting nodes from an XML document.
<p>XPath Used to compute values from XML.
<p>XPath is a format to identify individual pieces of your data in XML file.</p>
<p><b>What is Apache ActiveMQ?</b></p>
<p>Apache ActiveMQ is an open source message broker written in Java together with a full(JMS)Java Message Service client.</p>
<p><b>What is Apache Camel?</b>
<p>Apache Camel is a lightweight integration framework which implements all Enterprise Integration patterns.You can easily integrate different applications using the required patterns. You can use Java, Spring XML, Scala or Groovy.</p>
<p><b>What is SIT?</b>
<p>System Integration Testing.It is the environment where Internal testing will take place.</p>
<p><b>UAT?</b></p>
<p> UAT is User Acceptance Testing.After SIT is over the application and its respective data are moved to UAT schema, where user Acceptance Testing will be done. Your clients technical team will test that. Finally after every testing is passed the application is moved to PROD environment.
</p>
<p><b>What is PROD?</b>
<p>It is a production environment where live data will be there.</p>
<p><b>What is DEV?</b></p>
<p>DEV is development environment.This is done by developers.</p>
<p><b>What is JSF?</b></p>
