<h1>Threading Concept:</h1>
		<p>
			<b>Thread : </b>Sub part of a program
		
	
		<p>
			<b>Multithreading in Java</b>
		<p>It is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously or
			concurrently.
		<p>Thread is a lightweight and sub-part of the program, a smallest
			unit of program or process.
		<p>We have 2 processes to achieve multi processing.
		<p>1. Multi processing
		<p>2.Multi threading
		<p>But we use multithreading than multiprocessing because threads
			share a common memory area.
		<p>
			<b>Advantages of Java Multithreading</b>
		<p>1) you can perform multiple tasks at same time.
		<p>2) You can saves time because these perform many tasks
			together.
		<p>3) Threads are independent so it doesn't affect other threads
			if exception occur in a single thread.
		<p>4) Save memory because all threads share common memory.
