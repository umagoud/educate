<h1>Agile Methodology</h1>
<p><b>Agile:</b> This is a specific type of Rapid Application Development.
It is newer than Waterfall but it is implemented using scum.
traditional method is waterfall development</p>
<p>Agile Methodology is a lightweight framework for helping teams.This given a constantly evolving functional and
 technical landscape, maintain a focus on the rapid delivery of business value. 
 this focus benefits the agile software. 
 <p>This is incremental and iterative development, where phases of the process are revisited time and again.
<p>Organizations are capable of significantly reducing the 
overall risk associated with software development.
<p> Easily adapting to changing requirements throughout the process.
 <p>business value  is continuing to be maximized throughout the development process.this is done by a process of continuous planning and feedback.
<p> In this by measuring and evaluating status based on the undeniable truth of working, testing software, much more accurate visibility into the actual progress of projects is available. Finally, as a result of following an agile process, at the conclusion of a project is a software system that much better addresses the business and customer needs.
 <p><b>Advantage</b></p>
 <p>In this by delivering working, tested, deployable software on an incremental basis, agile development delivers increased value, visibility, and adaptability much earlier in the life cycle, significantly reducing project risk.
  <p><b>Types of Agile Methodology</b></p>
<p>There is a number of specific agile development methods. Sometime, people referred to agile software methods as agile techniques. 
<p>Some popular agile techniques are 
<P>1.Scrum</P>
<P>2.Extreme Programming</P>
<P>3.Crystal</P>
<P>4.Adaptive Software Development</P>
 <P>5.Lean Software Development and etc.</P>
 <P><b> Scrum</b></P>
 <p>Scrum is an agile way to manage a project, usually software development. Agile software development with Scrum is often perceived as a methodology; but rather than viewing Scrum as methodology. it is a framework for managing a process.
 <p>Scrum is not a methodology. It simply provides structure, discipline and a framework for Agile development. The whole project is made up of a series of Sprints or Sprint Cycles (1 to n) where each Sprint is of the same duration.
 <p>Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing product development.
 </p>
 <p><b>Continuous Delivery</b>
 <p>Continuous delivery means that the team ensures every change can be deployed to production but may choose not to do it, usually due to business reasons. In order to do continuous deployment one must be doing continuous delivery
