									<strong>What is procedural programming?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>A procedural program divides the code into smaller blocks
									called procedures. Procedures can interact with each other. An
									important point to note in procedural programming is the idea
									of state. The state of a program is stored in variables. As the
									program execution goes on, the state changes. The actions
									(procedures or functions) will change the state (value of the
									variables). Prolog, Pascal, FORTRAN and PL/SQL are examples.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Drawbacks:</strong>
								</p>
								<p>In procedural language, if the programming code goes
									beyond around 25,000 lines, it becomes unmanageable and
									especially when the project comes for modification at a later
									stage.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>What is structured programming?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Structured programming is a design approach where complex
									systems are broken down into smaller and more manageable
									pieces. That is, the programmer divides the program&rsquo;s
									source code into logically structured chunks (blocks) of code.
									The advantage is, it makes programs more readable, more
									reliable and more easily maintainer. Structured programming can
									be seen as a subset of procedural programming. It is most
									famous for removing or reducing dependency on the GOTO
									statement.</p>
								<p>Delphi and COBOL are examples of structured programming
									language.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Advantages of structured programming language:</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Structured programming reduces the complexity. Modularity
									allows the programmer to tackle problems in logical fashion.
									Also, using logical structures ensure that the flow of control
									is clear and readable.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>What is java? </strong>
								</p>
								<p>Java (with a capital J) is a high-level, programming
									language, like C, FORTRAN, Smalltalk, Perl, and many others.
									And also we can say Java is an object-oriented programming
									language. This means that the language is based on the concept
									of an object. You can use Java to write computer applications
									and thousands of other things computer software can do. Using
									java we can build special programs called applets. Applet is a
									small java program that can be downloaded from the Internet and
									played safely within a web browser.</p>
								<p>
									<strong>What is the History of Java?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>1. Java was invented by James Gosling in the year of 1991
									developed by Sun Micro Systems of U.S.A. 2. In 1991, Patrick
									Naughton and James Gosling with his co-workers started a secret
									project called “Green” in Sun Micro System Company their
									primary aim to design a small computer language that could be
									used for consumer devices like cable TV switchboxes, Microwave
									ovens and remote controls. Gosling decided to call his language
									“oak”. 3. In 1992, they developed and delivered product called
									“*7” it was an extremely intelligent remote control. 4. In 1995
									“oak” was renamed as “java” because of some legal problems. The
									main reason is oak was the name of an already available
									computer language so they changed the name to java. 5. Many
									popular companies including IBM, Microsoft, Netscape and many
									others support java.</p>

								<p>
									<strong> Explain the features of java?</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Simple and small, Familiar, Object Oriented, Distributed, two
									Staged, platform Independent, Robust and Secure, Multithreaded,
									High performance, Dynamic, Extensible. <br> Simple and
									Small: Java is a simple and small language that can be learned
									easily, even if you have just started programming, and many
									features of C and CPP that are not added here like pointers,
									preprocessor header files, GOTO, SIZE OF, and TYPEDEF statement
									and JAVA does not contain data types STRUCT, and JAVA does not
									support operator overloading, template classes, multiple
									inheritance, global variables, pointers, header files and many
									others <br>Familiar: It is familiar language because java
									uses many constructs of C and CPP and therefore java is looks
									like a CPP code. <br>Object Oriented: Almost everything in
									java is a class, or an object. Any code that you write in java
									is inside a class. Java is purely Object Oriented and provides
									Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism. An
									Object is a software bundle of variables and related methods. <br>Distributed:
									Java is designed as a distributed language for creating
									applications on network it has the ability to share both data
									and programs. Java applications can open and access remote
									objects on internet very easily. RMI packages are used for
									creating distributed server and client application. <br>Two
									Stage Systems: Java is both compiled and interpreted language.
									Compiler (javac) is used to translate a java program into an
									intermediate language called java byte code (.class files), it
									is platform independent code and interpreter (java) is used to
									read each byte code instruction and to run on the computer. <br>Platform
									Independence: We know that, java compiler produce the byte
									code. The byte code can be executed on a variety of computers
									running on different operating systems such as windows 95/98,
									Windows NT, Sun Solaris and Mac OS. Another reason is, size of
									the primitive data types are machine independent. <br>Robust:
									Java is a robust language because it provides many safeguards
									to ensure reliable code. It has strict compile time checking,
									runtime checking, it is designed as a garbage-collected
									language to free the programmers from all memory management
									problems. Also provides the exception handling technique to
									handle the exceptions occurred at runtime. <br>Secure:
									Security is very important issue when you are going to
									implement a network based application. Java system doesn’t
									allow the virus affected applets to run. We are not using the
									pointers here, so programs cannot gain access to memory
									locations without proper authorization. <br>Multithreaded:
									Multithreading is the ability of an application to perform
									multiple tasks at the same time. For example when you watch a
									movie on your computer, one task of program is to handle sound
									effects and another handle screen display so simple programs do
									many tasks simultaneously. <br>High Performance: Java byte
									code was efficiently designed so that it would be easy to
									translate directly into native machine code for high
									performance by using a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler. Java is
									faster than other interpreted language. Since it is compiled
									and interpreted. Multithreading provides the overall execution
									speed of java programs. <br>Dynamic: Maintaining different
									versions of an application is very easy in Java.Java is capable
									of dynamically linking in new class libraries, methods and
									objects. In java almost everything will be done at run time. <br>Extensible:Java
									programs support functions written in other languages such as C
									and CPP. These functions are known as native methods. Native
									methods are linked dynamically at runtime.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>What is Object Oriented Programming Language?
										And explain the principles of OOP’s concept.</strong>
								</p>
								<p>
									Object Oriented Programming Language: <br> Object Oriented
									Programming language is an approach which provides the way of
									modularizing the programs or it is a programming methodology
									that helps to organize complex program through the use of
									inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism. <br>
									Principles of OOP’s concept: <br> <br> Class: Class
									is a User-defined abstract data type which contains data
									members and Member functions or it is a collection of similar
									objects. Declaring a Class: A Class is described by use of the
									‘class’ keyword the attributes and methods (Behavior) of a
									class are defined inside a class body. In java, the braces {}
									mark the beginning and the end of a class or method. Here we
									use the following notation.[ ] - optional< > - are mandatory
									(must) <br>Syntax: [Access-specifier][Modifier] class <br>
									{ <br> Data-type instance-variable1; <br> Data-type
									instance-variable2; <br> Data-type instance-variable-n; <br>
									Data-type methodname-1 (parameter list) <br> { <br>
									Body of method <br> } <br> Data-type method-name-n
									(parameter list) <br> { <br> Body of method <br>
									} <br> } <br> <br> Here data, or variable
									defined with in a class are called instance variable. The code
									is contained with in a method. <br> Ex: <br>
									ObjectDemo.java <br> <br> class Emp <br> { <br>
									int eno; <br> String name; <br> String desig; <br>
									double sal; <br> void getEmpDetails() <br> { <br>
									System.out.println (“eno=\t”+eno); <br> System.out.println
									(“ename=\t”+ename); <br> System.out.println
									(“desig:\t”+desig); <br> System.out.println
									(“sal:\t”+sal); <br> } <br> } <br> Class
									ObjectDemo <br> { <br> public static void main(String
									args[]) <br> { <br> Emp e=new Emp(); <br>
									e.eno=101; <br> e.ename=”Naresh”; <br>
									e.sal=20000.00; <br> e.desig=”Faculty”; <br>
									e.getEmpDetails(); <br> } <br> } <br>
									D:\java\javac ObjectDemo.java <br> D:\java\dir *.class <br>
									Emp.class <br> ObjectDemo.class <br> D:\java\java
									ObjectDemo <br> Output: <br> 101 <br> Naresh <br>
									Faculty <br> 20000.00 <br>
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Rules for Naming Classes:</strong>
								</p>
								<p>• A class name must not be a keyword in Java. • It can
									begin with a letter, an underscore (or) a $ symbol • The name
									must not contain embedded space or period (.) • It can contain
									characters from various alphabets like Greek, Hebrew and
									Japanese. • They can be of any length</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Conventions for naming classes:</strong>
								</p>
								<p>• A class name must be meaningful. • It usually
									represents a real life class • Class names are nouns and must
									begin with capital letters (Ex: TVs, Bike etc…) • If it is too
									long, the leading upper case letter and each subsequent word
									with a leading upper case letter. E.g., HelloWorld,
									FirstExample etc….</p>

								<p>
									<strong>Objects:</strong>
								</p>
								<P>Object is an instance of a class, or a runtime entity and
									every object is independent. Every object has a state, identity
									and behavior. State represented by the variables of that
									object, identity referred by the reference variable of that
									object, behavior represents the methods of that class.</P>
