							<strong>What is Data Science?<br></strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Data science, also known as data-driven science, is an
							interdisciplinary field about scientific processes and systems to
							extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either
							structured or unstructured, which is a continuation of some of
							the data analysis fields such as statistics, machine learning,
							data mining, and predictive analytics, similar to Knowledge
							Discovery in Databases (KDD).<br> <br> A New Field
							Emerges<br> There is significant and growing demand for
							data-savvy professionals in businesses, public agencies, and
							nonprofits. <br>
							<br>The supply of professionals who can work effectively
							with data at scale is limited, and is reflected by rapidly rising
							salaries for data engineers, data scientists, statisticians, and
							data analysts.<br> A recent study by the McKinsey Global Institute
							concludes, "a shortage of the analytical and managerial talent
							necessary to make the most of Big Data is a significant and
							pressing challenge (for the U.S.)."<br><br> The report estimates that
							there will be four to five million jobs in the U.S. requiring
							data analysis skills by 2018, and that large numbers of positions
							will only be filled through training or retraining.<br> The authors
							also project a need for 1.5 million more managers and analysts
							with deep analytical and technical skills "who can ask the right
							questions and consume the results of analysis of big data
							effectively." <br>The statistics listed below represent this
							significant and growing demand for data scientists.<br>
							<br> "Data Scientist" has become a popular occupation with
							Harvard Business Review dubbing it "The Sexiest Job of the 21st
							Century" and McKinsey & Company projecting a global excess demand
							of 1.5 million new data scientists. Universities are offering
							masters courses in data science. <br>Shorter private bootcamps are
							also offering data science certificates including student-paid
							programs like General Assembly to employer-paid programs like The
							Data Incubator <br> #16<br> Highest Paying Job in
							Demand<br> 3,433 <br> Number of Job Openings<br>

							Job in America for 2016<br> <br> An Explosion of Data<br>
							Data is increasingly cheap and ubiquitous.<br> <br>We
							are now digitizing analog content that was created over centuries
							and collecting myriad new types of data from web logs, mobile
							devices, sensors, instruments, and transactions.<br> IBM estimates
							that 90 percent of the data in the world today has been created
							in the past two years. At the same time, new technologies are
							emerging to organize and make sense of this avalanche of data.<br>
							<br> We can now identify patterns and regularities in data
							of all sorts that allow us to advance scholarship, improve the
							human condition, and create commercial and social value. <br>The rise
							of "big data" has the potential to deepen our understanding of
							phenomena ranging from physical and biological systems to human
							social and economic behavior1. <br>A Challenge Identified<br>
							Virtually every sector of the economy now has access to more data
							than would have been imaginable even a decade ago. <br>Businesses
							today are accumulating new data at a rate that exceeds their
							capacity to extract value from it. <br>The question facing every
							organization that wants to attract a community is how to use data
							effectively — not just their own data, but all of the data that's
							available and relevant. "This hot new field promises to
							revolutionize industries from business to government, health care
							to academia."<br> — The New York Times<br> <br>
							<br> Our ability to derive social and economic value from
							the newly available data is limited by the lack of expertise.<br>
							Working with this data requires distinctive new skills and tools.
							The corpuses are often too voluminous to fit on a single
							computer, to manipulate with traditional databases or statistical
							tools, or to represent using standard graphics software<br>
							The data is also more heterogeneous than the highly curated data
							of the past. Digitized text, audio, and visual content, like
							sensor and blog data, is typically messy, incomplete, and
							unstructured; <br>it is often of uncertain provenance and quality;
							and frequently must be combined with other data to be useful.
							Working with user-generated data sets also raises challenging
							issues of privacy, security, and ethics.<br> The field of data
							science is emerging at the intersection of the fields of social
							science and statistics, information and computer science, and
							design. <br>The UC Berkeley School of Information is ideally
							positioned to bring these disciplines together and to provide
							students with the research and professional skills to succeed in
							leading edge organizations. <br>
							<br> Data Science <br> Data scientist has been called
							“the sexiest job of the 21st century,” presumably by someone who
							has never visited a fire station. Nonetheless, data science is a
							hot and growing field, and it doesn’t take a great deal of
							sleuthing to find analysts breathlessly prognosticating that over
							the next 10 years, we’ll need billions and billions more data
							scientists than we currently have. <br>
							<br> But what is data science? After all, we can’t produce
							data scientists if we don’t know what data science is. According
							to a Venn diagram that is somewhat famous in the industry, data
							science lies at the intersection of: • Hacking skills <br> •
							Math and statistics knowledge <br> • Substantive expertise <br>
							<br> Although I originally intended to write a book covering
							all three, I quickly realized that a thorough treatment of
							“substantive expertise” would require tens of thousands of pages.
							At that point, I decided to focus on the first two. My goal is to
							help you develop the hacking skills that you’ll need to get
							started doing data science. <br>And my goal is to help you
							get comfortable with the mathematics and statistics that are at
							the core of data science. This is a somewhat heavy aspiration for
							a book. <br>The best way to learn hacking skills is by
							hacking on things. <br>By reading this book, you will get a
							good understanding of the way I hack on things, which may not
							necessarily be the best way for you to hack on things. You will
							get a good understanding of some of the tools I use, which will
							not necessarily be the best tools for you to use.<br>
							<br> You will get a good understanding of the way I approach
							data problems, which may not necessarily be the best way for you
							to approach data problems. <br>
							<br>The intent (and the hope) is that my examples will
							inspire xi www.it-ebooks.info you try things your own way.<br>
							All the code and data from the book is available on GitHub to get
							you started. Similarly, the best way to learn mathematics is by
							doing mathematics.<br> This is emphat‐ ically not a math
							book, and for the most part, we won’t be “doing mathematics.”
							How‐ ever, you can’t really do data science without some
							understanding of probability and statistics and linear algebra.<br>
							<br> This means that, where appropriate, we will dive into
							mathematical equations, mathematical intuition, mathematical
							axioms, and cartoon versions of big mathematical ideas. <br>I hope
							that you won’t be afraid to dive in with me. <br>Throughout it all, I
							also hope to give you a sense that playing with data is fun,
							because, well, playing with data is fun! (Especially compared to
							some of the alterna‐ tives, like tax preparation or coal mining.)
